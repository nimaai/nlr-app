This kirtan was held every night at Shrivasa's home and occasionally at Chandra-Shekhara's. Mukunda commenced with the auspicious invocation of the kirtan and then chanted 'Rama Krishna Narahari Gopala Govinda !' Everyone was there - Nityananda, Gadadhara, Advaita, Shrivasa, Vidya-Nidhi, Murari, Hiranya, Haridasa, Gangadasa Vanamali, Vijaya-Nandana, Jagadananda, Buddhimanta Khan, Narayana, Kashishvara, Vasudeva, Rama, Garuda, Govinda, Govindananda, Gopinatha, Jagadisha, Shriman, Shridhara, Sadashiva, Vakreshvara, Bhugarbha,Shuklambara, Brahmananda, Purushottama, Sanjaya, and so on -uncountable servants of Shri Gauranga were there - I know them all by name.

Seeing everyone forcefully tumbling and falling 'upon the ground, Govinda Dasa came forward and shut his eyes. Sometimes Gauranga manifested Himself in the mood of God and sometimes He would weep and exclaim, 'I am but a lowly servant!' Thus in the sacred courtyard of Shrivasa the auspicious uproar of ktrtan arose with the names 'Gopala ! Govinda !'","The Ecstatic Chanting and Dancing Escalates","Shrivasa took charge of one group as Mukunda took another and ran this way and that. Govinda Datta took charge of yet another and everyone did kirtan as Gauranga-Chandra danced. Sometimes the greatly muscular Nityananda would grab hold of Lord Gauranga, as Advaita secretly took the dust of His feet. Gadadhara and his group had tearful eyes and were completely overcome with bliss by Lord Gauranga's kirtan. When Prabhu Vishvambhara danced and stomped vigorously on the ground the earth trembled and everyone scattered in fear. Sometimes as Lord Gauranga Vishvambhara danced at a moderate pace, He appeared to be Lord Krishna Nanda-Nandana, the best of dancers. The next moment meditating inwardly, He would hold His bands as if He were playing a flute and thus looked exactly like Vrindavan-Chandra Himself.

Seeing Lord Gauranga's ecstatic bliss, the Bhagavata devotees held each others' necks and wept. The divine limbs of everyone were smeared with divine chandan and they were adorrned with flower garlands. Ecstatically chanting Krishna's name they forgot all else in the world.

The rhythm of His feet striking the earth is most enchanting. Lord Gauranga looks at all the Vaishnavas one by one. Overcome with ecstatic moods, the devotees loudly repeat the names of the Lord's previous incarnations. Even Lord Haladhara, Shiva, Shuka, Narada, Prahlada, Lakshmi, Aja, nd Uddhava all chanted along with this kirtan of Lord Gauranga. As before, great care is taken that no outsiders enter the courtyard and behold this scene. Just as so many yugas elapsed during the performance of the maha-rasa dance - all the gopis in this present incarnation now consider such a length of time to pass like half a mustard-seed. In this way Krishna's inconceivable manifestation blossomed and only the fortunate servants of Shri Gauranga could come here.","(There is a poem in this regard) 'Jaya re! Jaya re!

Radha Vrindavaneshvari is the personification of maha-bhava - She has now incarnated as Gadadhara Pandita.","And Vrajendra-Nandana is the personification of the King of rasa - He has fully manifested as this Gauranga-Chandra. One who endeavors to worship on the raganuga-marga the path of spontaneous devotion follows the disciples of Pandita Gosai (Gadadhara Pandita). Without following them, Vraja cannot be attained. Therefore the Goswamis of Vraja are branches of this disciplic succession. He whom LakshmiDevi meditates upon, even executing austerities for the purpose of attaining Him, but still not attaining her desire - this Vrajendra-Nandana is truly loved by Radha.","Indeed, She is overwhelmed with prema for Him at every moment nd now this Radha has become Gadadhara Panitta Gosai who is madly engrossed in the nectar-mellows of Gauranga-prema. Therefore one who is devoid of attachment to Gadadhara cannot attain prema-bhakti, but instead becomes totally destitute. If someone does not believe in this principle he cannot be delivered for a million births, and is completely ruined.","My prayer at the feet of Gadadhara-Gauranga is that I have never had association with Your true followers. I have been pleased to associate with sinful atheists and I am pierced by the spears of Gadadhara Pandita's blasphemers. My mind is full of attachment to drinking liquor and I have frightfully kept the company of other drunkards. Still, perpetually hoping for the lotus feet of Gadadhara-Gauranga Lochana Dasa begs for shelter under these feet.","(Another song by Lochana Dasa)","Dear mind, just worship, just worship the son of Madhava known as Gadadhara! Whoever takes shelter of his lotus feet goes to Vraja-dhama. Previously he appeared in Vrishabhanu's house at Vraja-pura bearing the name Radhika. In the company of Her girlfriends, fond of playful pranks, She serves Shyama Krishna and makes Him happy. That form is now this form, the same Queen of relishable mellows. Just worship Her incessantly with single-minded attention. Now in the company of Gauranga , Radha has incarnated and sports playfully in the dress of a renounced male ascetic Gadadhara. Coming to Nilachala and living in the company of many devotees Gadadhara has delivered many countries. The entire universe is swimming in the flood of prema that he has brought , which vanquished all the miseries of everyone. But this sinful soul has never seen that cean of prema, says Lochana Dasa.","(Another song by Lochana Dasa)","In hope for Gadadhara, Gadadhara, Gadadhara - if you attain Gadadhara you get residence in Vraja-pura. Taking the name of Gadadhara I will become an ascetic. I will eat from my waterpot and wear a simple loincloth. These are the hopes of my mind for many days now. With my ears I will hear about Gadadhara-Gauranga-prema.Dear Lords! Only those who know You can be a guru or a disciple in Your lineage. Only persons bereft of eyes reject You and uselessly attempt to perform devotional service. One who is devoid of attachment to Gadadhara's lotus feet remains fallen in the ocean of birth and death.","In hope of attaining the lotus feet of Gadadhara, Lochana Dasa begs for remembrance of those feet.","(Another poem)","Re! Some say that Gauranga is Janaki-vallabha (Lord Rama), the beloved of Radha, or Pancha Vana (Cupid with 5 flower arrows). But in the mind of the poet Nayanananda I know nothing other than this - that Gauranga is the life and soul of my Gadadhara . Re !' The Kirtan is Concluded.

Then Shachi begins to prepare edibles - and fixes her eyes on the path where Gauranga will appear. Gauranga bids farewell to all the devotees and proceeds toward His own home. On some nights after kirtan during the Summertime He bathes in the Ganga with the devotees in the moonlight. Arriving at home, servants wipe His body with fine damp cloths to relieve His fatigue from sporting so much chanting and dancing during the kirtan. Changing Him into fresh clothes they wash His sacred feet and He sits upon an asana to take prasad. Shachi Devi brings numerous offerings on golden trays and places them within the sight of her son. She comes over and sits before Him to behold His face and overflowing with pure loving affection, she eagerly urges Him to feast again and again.","Lord Gauranga Mahaprabhu eats while smiling gently as Lakshmi Vishnu-Priya looks on , filling her eyes.

Mother Shachi lights a ghee-lamp scented with camphor on a golden tray, then jubilantly places it in the hands of Malini (wife of Shrivasa Thakura), who offers it as arati to the gorgeous Gauranga-Sundara.","The male servants attentively bring in a golden footstool, full water pitchers, a tongue scraper, tooth powder, and so forth. Leaving the room, Gauranga comes out into the courtyard. Going to another room in the house, He conducts His morning activities. Then He comes out and sits down with His foot upon a footstool. After brushing His teeth and other duties, He goes and sits on a very elevated sitting place. Then His devotees, who have also just finished their morning practices, begin to arrive - Prabhu Nityananda, Shri Advaita, Gadadhara, Mukunda, Murari, Haridasa, Vakreshvara, Shuklambara Brahmachari, Shridhara and others.","Coming together at the Lord's house, all the devotees successively offer their respects at His feet in the appropriate manner.

It cannot even be described with words! Description of Shrimati Vishnu-Priya's Beauty Then Vishnu-Priya Devi very playfully goes in the company of her girlfriends to bathe in the Sura-dhuni river. The complexion of her body conquers that of a golden lotus and her most lovely face radiates the splendor of how many moons? Her braid graces her hips like a great snake and it is bound with golden threads interwoven with strands of bakula flowers. Her wavy locks appear to be swarms of bumblebees and her two cheeks sparkle like mirrors.Her ears are adorned with jewel-studded earrings swinging from which are tiny ornaments inlaid with pearls.","To support the weight of this extraordinary ear-ornament a golden chain, is fastened to a post in her earlobe and loops over her ear. The part in her hair is bordered by tiny pearls tied on golden threads and interspersed with rubies. On her forehead is a dot of sindura tinted reddish like the rising sun both sides of which are embellished with designs drawn in dark musk. Further designs in musk beautify her cheeks and her pleasingly-colored lips form an enchantingly gentle smile. Her fickle eyes dart about like the movements of a wagtail bird as Cupid himself trembles in fear to see the movements of her eyebrows.","Her nose conquers the beauty of the sesame flower and an elephant-pearl swings from it. Around her neck is an ornamental necklace interwoven with jasmine garlands From her neck descends a splendrous array of golden necklaces, arranged in successive loops from small to large. The beauty of her breasts puts to shame that of golden waterpitchers and they are encircled with champaka flowerbuds. Her breasts are adorned with vines drawn in sandalwood paste and bordered with strands of precious elephant-pearls. Her two arms appear as golden lotus-stems and they are decorated with conchshell-bangles and other ornaments. Her upper arms are encircled by armlets that are bordered with silk dangling from which, are golden charms. From her reddish palms extend fingers adorned with rings and her index finger shines with a golden ornament that is studded with mirrors.

Very happy in her mind to receive this order, Vishnu-Priya immediately goes and sits down to cook. All the cooking duties performed by Malini are directed by the gestures of Sita Thakurani. First they cook sweet rice. Upon its completion it is transferred to a new container. Numerous types of spinach are prepared then arum-root, eggplant and many other items. Assorted vegetables are minced and spiced with black pepper. Pea soup is made with dried mango pieces. Many varieties of curries soaked in ghee are kept separately. Ground kidney-bean patties and ground pea patties are nicely fried in ghee.","Coconut-cereal is fried along with cakes made from flowers. There are different kinds of eggplant mixed with sesame seeds. Much effort and attention is given in all this cooking. The sweet and the sour preparations are kept separately.

Wheat is formed into coils, fried in ghee and soaked in sweet juice. Cheese and condensed milk is kneaded with sugar and formed into laddus shaped like pomegranates. They make sweets from pumpkin and also disc-shaped crispy cakes. Large quantities of cucumber and chick-peas are fried in ghee.

There are mustard-powder soup, plum pickles and many more things that are brought and placed outside. Then Shachi Devi comes into the kitchen and is overjoyed to view the assortment of cooked preparations. She addresses her daughter-in-law. 'What is the delay with the cooking?' Vishnu-Priya is embarrassed and does not say a word in reply. So Malini speaks up. 'Oh Shachi Devi ! The cooking is finished. There is no more delay.' Shachi says, 'Good! I have personally cleaned Lord Vishnu's eating-room with my own hands. Now I am quickly going to arrange the offering there.' Saying this, she goes outside and says to Ishana.

Along the way , He has many conversations with the devotees. Then, in their company Shri Gauranga Raya enters the waters of the Ganga and offers His obeisances unto her.","(From the Chaitanya Bhagavat)","'Who could possibly describe the opulence of Nadiya? At one bathing place, thousands and thousands of people bathe Some are peaceful saints, some austere ascetics, some sannyasis I don't know how many children come there and mix in the crowds! The Jahnavi (Ganga) encircles the Lord on all sides and He secretly offers her own water unto her ripples On the plea of making waves, the Jahnavi dances even though her feet are served by residents of limitless universes. Navadvipa Raya played water-sports in the Ganga river while the residents of Nadiya looked on in the greatest fortune. As Prabhu Vishvambhara played in the waters of the Ganga He looked just like the full moon itself playing in the ocean All the fortunate souls who had come to the landing to bathe incessantly beheld the face of Vishvambhar. ' One male servant (dasa) comes forward to massage the Lord attentively rubbing and cleansing His body. Then Prabhu bathes in the company of His devotees and they ascend the riverbank with much playful sporting.

The finest betel nuts are made pleasant by adding cloves and cardamon and are put into a bejewelled box.

Then Sita Devi takes Malini and the devotees' wives. Shachi comes forward and seats them all, feeding them to the great delight of her heart. After eating the wives return to their own homes and Shachi finally eats along with Vishnu-Priya. They wash their mouths and go to sit in a solitary place, as the servants headed by Ishana come for their own meal. The servants then clean the house.

Then Lord Gauranga washes His face and sits down with a supremely blissful mind. After resting briefly all the devotees carefully attend their own duties. They are very eager to meet with the Lord, but knowing it is not time yet , they do not go to Him. Some of them deliberate on the Bhagavat-shastra. Some of them mingle in Advaita's room. Some of them gather in groups of five or seven and perform kirtan while clapping their hands. Thus the devotees associate together each in their own way.

Stoka Krishna! He Arjuna! 0 Brother Balarama!' Seeing Mahaprabhu's condition, the hearts of Gadadhara and the others are overcome with ecstasy as their eyes brim with tears. In this mood they sport numerous pastimes.","Then Gauranga Shri Hari gets up and quickly proceeds to Shridhara's house. Seeing Gauranga arrive along with His associates, Shridhara gets up.

This flower garden is a grandly expansive place. In all four directions are groups of very tall kadamba trees. At the base of these kadamba trees are dense screwpine bushes which are encircled by thorns. Seeing this thorny forest from afar, the common people never come her. Madhavi and malati jasmine-vines climb up and embrace the kadamba trees. The pleasant south wind blows, carrying flower-pollen with its breezes. In four directions are four paths formed with jewels. In two directions are beautiful rows of bakula trees. The forest blooms with small white kunda-jasmine buds, splender, red amaranth, tagara flower-trees, groups of jewelled gardens, nageshvara flowers, and many other varieties of fragrant jasmines like jati, yuthi and mallika. Bakula trees, clove-pink vines, pink trumpet-flowers, and guelder-roses are beautifully manifest in row after row.","White lilies, yellow magnolias, and many red flame-trees are blooming.

Temples bloom with trees of pinkish color accented here and there by flowering mango-saplings. At the base of the trees are seen beautiful groups of rose-apple bushes, jackfruits and so many juicy limes. The inner part of the forest is surrounded by groves of banana trees. Some are bearing ripe fruits while others bear unripe green ones. Rows and rows of coconut trees hold many, many fruits. Among the rows of betel trees are date-palms and wood-apple trees. There are sweet jujube berries, oranges, plums, plus cardamon and clove vines. All the fruit and flower-trees are so full with offerings that their branches bend down and touch the ground","Pomegranates are bursting and soaking the ground with their juice. Hedges of jujube berries appear very beautiful. There are so many varieties of trees that they defy description. In the center of the garden is a colorful temple. Just in front of it is a lake full of cool waters. The landing-steps are formed of crystal slabs. On four sides are four bathing places inlaid with jewels. Surrounding the lake are lilies-of-the-valley formed of gold, white sephalika flowers, golden champaka creepers, and moonlike mallika jasmines. All these beautiful flowerbeds line the bank of the lake and their reflections can be seen in its pure waters. From the weight of all the flowers, their stems bend down and caress the surface of the water.","Sweet little ripples move along with the gentle breeze. Lotuses of white, blue, red and more are in full bloom. These lotuses sway so much that the bumblebees cannot land on them. Greedy for honey, millions of bees fly all around. Royal swans, storks, herons, partridges and many other birds playfully sport in all directions. The fish living within the water move about by the hundreds.","In a golden temple, upon a golden altar sits Lord Gauranga of golden complexion. Surrounding Him are His associates also of golden complexion, Their limbs tremble out of pure prema and their eyes are wet with tears. There are twelve gates supported by reddish-golden pillars. On the outside are golden posts holding up a nice canopy. These gates are interwoven with garlands of mallika-jasmines. The top edges have clusters of hanging sapphires that sway to and fro. The East courtyard has groves of divine Tulasi plants. The West courtyard has groves of colorful flame-trees. The North and South have grasses of dark Syamala color which bring to mind soft pillows to sit on. Pet deer roam all about in search of grass to eat and they spread their eyes wide upon beholding the beauty of Gauranga. A peacock alights from a magnolia tree upon seeing Gauranga there and begins to dance in great happiness.","The trees and creepers all bloom with golden flowers. The forest is perpetually served by the Six Seasons. The sparrows chirp loudly and the cuckoos are all-pervading. Male and female waterfowl wander around on the ground. Parrots see ripe bimba berries and peck them with their beaks. Bluebirds and doves sport within the trees.

As Gauranga-Chanda approaches the outskirts both sides of Him are ornamented by Nityananda and Gadadhara. Following behind is the assembly of devotees, whose minds are all filled with bliss as they walk pleasantly. As Gauranga returns on the footpath to Navadvipa all the townspeople turn their heads to behold His enchanting beauty. His muscular, golden body is very tall and its sheer grace is like a lotus of pure desire in spotless waters. His knee-length arms sway back and forth as he walks. They appear as lotus-stems, or elephant trunks - they cannot be described","His curling tresses are so lovely they mesmerize the entire universe and they are tied with the shyness of all the young girls. His wavy locks swing like a swarm of bumblebees and the chandan tilak upon His forehead diffuses rays just like a nectar-moon","Fixing the flower-arrows of His restless eyes upon the bow of His eyebrows, He instantly pierces the hearts of the womenfolk by His mere glance.

Description of the Town of Navadvipa","Lord Gauranga now enters on the main road into Navadvipa and as the people hear of it, women, men, young and old all run to see Him. The sand on the road to Nadiya is white as a lotus flower and on both sides rise lofty palaces of pure white finish. Banners with golden lotus symbols are touching the sky as white, yellow and other colorful flags blow in the wind. The rooftop apartments are constructed with bewildering optical illusions and the gates to the houses are festooned with fluttering jasmine garlands. All the women who live along the road that Gauranga is traversing ascend their rooftops with great desire to behold Him. Does it appear that a garland of nectar-moons is rising in the sky with the clouds of their loosened hair flowing by their cheeks? Their jewelled necklaces appear like the rising stars and the waves of their smiles the striking of lightning","Their soft chit-chatting is like the clouds' sweet gentle rumbling and their eyes the lotuses in the pond of affection. The handsome body of Gauranga is like a golden mountain peak upon which these girls shower the rains of loving attachment. From behind windows and portals some fix their eyes peering steadily down the path that Gauranga is travelling","The town of Navadvipa extends for an area of four yojanas (32 square miles] . Here and there are flower gardens and heavenly lakes. All the palaces accomodate so many temples of numerous devatas above which are splendrous rows and rows of beautiful spires. There are four classes of people - the brahmanas, Kshatriyas, vaishyas and shudras and their lovely homes shine in many orderly rows. Uncountable yogis, sannyasis, and brahmacharis live there. In some places there is recitation of the Bhagavad-Gita and the Puranas. In some places is the excitement of dancing, singing and playing on musical instruments. In some places small children loudly bicker and squabble. In some places uncountable children are playing. In some places numberless vipras study the scriptures In some places groups and groups of bhattacharyas congregate. Everyone walks along the roads of Nadiya. Three kinds of people travel on these roads - young, middle-aged and old and they all gaze incessantly upon the face of Gauranga and chant His Holy Name. Here and there are kadamba and bakula trees. All around their bases are supremely splendrous platforms. The town has marketplaces, vestibules and courtyards packed with dense crowds of celestial people. In the center of town are many, many mango trees among which are perpetually blossoming flower gardens. Surrounding the town are the flowing currents of the Sura-dhuni upon whose banks Gauranga sports enchanting pastimes","The Glories of Navadvip","(From the Chaitanya-Bhagavat)","There is no town like Navadvipa within the entire three worlds for it is where Guaranga Gosai has taken birth Understanding that Prabhu was going to appear there the Creator had made that place complete (sampurna).","Oh friends ! Please listen to the meaning of the word 'sampurna' Everyone has not understood it, even after contemplating it. Great truth has been concentrated into very few letters. If one ponders it, then priceless jewels will be gained. Within the ocean are vast quantities of gemstones although the eyes can see nothing but water. Sinful blind persons have no eyes to see anything but water. Even if they hear of something else they do not believe it. Just as things within the ocean are not visible similarly the words of Vrindavan Dasa have a deeper purpose. No one can grasp the direct meaning of these statements - but only one whose heart is attached to Gauranga can understand. Some say that the word 'sampurna' indicates the fourteen worlds. Who can comprehend the sweetness of this direct meaning? It denotes the extent of all the pleasures in the universe Including beauty, majestic potency, and virtuous conduct, plus the intoxicating essence of the topmost limit of all knowledge, devotion, intelligence, wealth, mercy, glorious family dynasties and so on as well as perfectly complete proficiency in the abilities of relishment and mastery of all forms of craftsmanship - the word 'sampurna' is full of all these meanings. Now there is yet another nectarean thing to speak of. Hearing about it pleases one's ears and mind. The following words have issued forth from the mouth of the son of Narayani (Vrindavan Dasa Thakura):","navadvipa je hena mathura raja-dhani","This Navadvipa is just like the opulent capital city of Mathura","Vrindavan Dasa is the object of Nityananda Prabhu's mercy, Who illumines him with the constant presence of His divine grace. One who thinks he can understand Vrindavan Dasa's statements is merely puffed-up with the illusory concept of scholarship and simply dies while engrossed in the false ego!","(A song by Narahari Ghanashyama:)(refrain","'Glories, glories to Shri Navadvipa, the abode of happiness! Peoples of the four ashrams dwell in wonderful homes, Where unparalleled festivals are observed according to custom.'","It is the place where the eight mystic perfections and the nine opulences are the humble servant in every home Where those who are attached to dharma, artha, kama and moksha are merely ridiculed. Where the extremely severe threefold miseries are vanquished and the ninefold processes of bhakti shine continuously. Where the area is so full to overflowing with spotlessly pure prema that all the non-moving as well as the moving living beings remain everlastingly intoxicated in divine madness. Where the town is beautified by thousands of diverse residences and is encircled by the pure white waters of the Sura-dhuni where young kunda-jasmine blossoms and strands of fine pearls appear as if a host of full moons have simultaneously arisen Where the overall splendor is new and ever fresh just like Vrindavan and is served by six seasons that are succulent out to the horizon.","Where the charming and grand glories are so expansive that Shesha Naga ever sings of them and never reaches their limit. The best of the demigods, four-faced Lord Brahma, in the company of the other devas, meditates on the exalted, limitless rasa manifest in this place. Ghanashyama narrates - may I eventually live in that place in the company of my Lord Gaurangaa and His associates.","Gauranga Mahaprabhu Sits on the Bank of the Ganga","Thus Lord Gauranga wanders about the town for a while then He proceeds on the path to the Sura-dhuni. Coming to the bank of the Ganga along with His associates. Gauranga Mahaprabhu, the moon over Nadiya sits down near a bathing landing. The bank of the Sura-dhuni shines with very beautiful meadows where so many shala, piyala and kadamba trees grow. There are peacocks, cuckoos and many bees flying amongst flower-fields in thick swarms. The bathing ghata is paved step by step in stone slabs with countless Shiva shrines on the upper level. Here and there are uncommon residential quarters in front of which flow the supremely pure waters. Sitting on this Ganga-ghata is Gauranga-Sundara. His form of Madana-Mohana is captivating to all. His charming face is continuously marked with smiles as He jokes and converses with His own associates. All the women who had come to get water from the river give up their shyness and gaze continuously upon the face of Gauranga. Some who were already carrying jugs full of water on top of their heads - as soon as they behold Gauranga, their hands slip from steadying their pots which fall and crash upon the ground. Here and there are thousands and thousands of vipras sitting in groups along with townswomen. Also uncountable bhattacharyas and their students are congregating and discussing the scriptures amongst themselves. What grand splendor is manifest on both sides of this Ganga ! Especially brilliant is the appearance of Gauranga-Chanda","(From the Chaitanya-Bhagavat)","'Sitting on the bank is Shri Shachi-Nandana surrounded on four sides by His disciples It is just like Shri Nanda - Kumara Krishna on the bank of the Yamuna having fun amongst His cowherd boyfriends. Krishna-Chandra has now taken His cowherd boyfriends and sports numerous pranks in the form of a brahmana on the bank of the Ganga. Those people who happen to look upon Lord Gauranga's face there at the river obtain an absolutely indescribable type of happiness. Affected by Prabhu's extremely potent and masterful influence all the people on the bank of the Ganga warmly embrace each other. Glancing toward the teachers of the schools, Prabhu sits there and expounds His own commentaries Fortunate people watch as they surround Him on all sides, for by Lord Gauranga's power all of Navadvipa is free from miseries. Thus in the company of the devotees, Shri Shachi-Nandana offers obeisances to the Ganga and proceeds home. Prabhu travels on the main road into Nadiya during the time of the cows' return home. Herds and herds of cows are entering the town tended by hundreds and hundreds of cowherd boys. Many calves playfully follow behind with their tails raised aloft. Seeing this scene brings great delight to Prabhu's heart and with a choked voice He calls out the names of Krishna's cows, 0 white Dhavali !' and so on. Thousands upon thousands of vipras are coming on the path from the Ganga to perform their sandhya rituals at dusk. Numberless young brahmana boys also proceed toward their homes making a tumultuous commotion as they recite and hear scriptural verses. Lord Gauranga returns to His own home and sits down as His devotees all go and return to their own homes also. Then the bliss of Shachi Devi's heart swells up. As she sees the face of her dear son, her ocean of happiness overflows. Slowly and quietly she comes and sits before Gauranga. Overpowered with affection she wipes His limbs with her own cloth.
